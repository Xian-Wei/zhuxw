Was it FOMO that led me to embark on this stupid challenge ?

Fear, uncertainty and doubt is a perfect description of my emotions during this
soul-crushing month of watching my net worth nosedive.

# 2024 is off to a great start

The day after starting the shitcoin challenge, I woke up to a promising 150
dollars increase on my original investment.\
We're talking about a **7.55% increase** in less than 24 hours, on a diversified
portfolio of 7 random coins.

I thought perhaps I had discovered a newfound investing genius ? \
Could I be the next Warren Buffett ?

Spoiler alert: that optimism aged like milk left out in the counter.

It was a downward spiral. Literally.

It was like riding an rollercoaster, except that it doesn't go up and down, it
goes **STRAIGHT DOWN**.

The day following my gains, I opened my app to a sea of crimson red and my gains
had vanished into thin air.

From $2258.61 to a disheartening $2012.03â€”a staggering $246.58 drop, marking a
10.91% freefall from the all-time high **in a single day**.

And the succeeding days ? LMAO.

Let's just say they haven't been very green, they've been more of a scarlet,
bloody tone.

Watching my money go down the drain at this pace has been a very interesting and
soul-crushing experience.

My portfolio is currently at **1709.07 dollars**, meaning I'm down 390.93
dollars or 18.61% from my initial investment **in 1 month.**

Fuck Aleph Zero.

## Conclusion

The takeaway from this challenge thus far ? Doing the opposite of my investing
strategies is a surefire path to millionnaire status.

At this rate, I might actually turn 2100 dollars to 0.

Let's fucking go.

**PS: I'm making the thumbnail right now and the candlestick chart on the
illustration is literally Aleph fucking Zero right now on a 4-hour timeframe.**
