As we approach 2025, this challenge is coming to a close, and I couldn't be more
thrilled at the thought of finally offloading these underperforming, garbage
coins.

We're a bit off the lows, but honestly, it's still very disappointing. \
The chart looks more like a playground slide than a recovery.

**Aleph Zero.**

That's all I'm going to say.

## Conclusion

At this point, I'm just hoping to break even by the end of the year.

On a positive note, October has historically been a strong month for financial
assets, so I'm expecting good things from Uptober.

See you in November for a massive pump (manifesting it).
