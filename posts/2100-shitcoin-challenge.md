## Introduction

I have just "invested" 300 dollars each in 7 different shitcoins.

Now, you may be wondering, why on earth would I buy shitcoins ?

I've been struggling to find post ideas in 2023, so this will provide me with an
easy monthly post to ensure that my blog doesn't gather dust.

## Why these coins and why $2100 ?

I've set the initial value to $2100, inspired by the lucky number 21. \
The 7, representing the number of coins, adds a jackpot vibe with 777.

As for why I chose these coins, the reasoning behind it is very straightforward.

I picked them solely because their logo looks cool, and their names exude pure
badassery.

That's it, there's nothing more to it.

## Challenge details

I will be posting my PnL (Profit and Loss) monthly, ranking them from the best
to the worst performer (monthly and overall).

To maintain consistency, snapshots will always be taken on the first of every
month.

These coins were bought 30 minutes ago, precisely from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM on
January 1st 2024.

Without further ado, this is my shitcoin portfolio :

- 200 $AZERO | Aleph Zero
- 1423 $UOS | Ultra
- 2700 $KAS | Kaspa
- 31934 $MYRIA | Myria
- 500 $STG | Stargate Finance
- 234 $MNW | Morpheus Network
- 508 $ARKM | Arkham

All of these coins are currently worth exactly 300 dollars.

**Exceptional update 1 day later**:\
I'm up $150 since all coins have increased $20 to $30 in value, totaling $2258.61.\
Life is great.

**Final update 2 days later**:\
I'm now down almost $100 from the initial value, bringing the portfolio to $2012.03.\
Life is not so great.

## Conclusion

No research was conducted before purchasing these coins.

I will lose everything.

This is not financial advice.

Thank you for reading.
