I've hosted my very first radio show.

As someone who tends to lean into introversion, stepping into the world of radio hosting and going out of my comfort zone was a pretty rewarding experience I must say.

There happened to be an empty slot at 8 PM for a local radio that my friend works in, so I thought "Why not give it a shot ?"

And that's how it all began - me, my vocal cords and my trusty HyperX Quadcast (#ad, sponsor this blog please).

## The reality of radio shows

I had always thought of radio shows being live, but in reality, most of it is pre-recorded. \
Since Covid happened, things have transitioned from live to pre-recorded recordings. \
This worked to my advantage because I wouldn't have managed a live show on my own without preparations. \
All I had to do was pick songs of my liking, choose the order, and send voice clips of me transitioning songs.

So I downloaded Audacity, prepared my text on Word and got started. \
To be completely honest, I cringed so hard that I didn't even listen to my voice clips after recording and sent them immediately to the editor. \
We were in a hurry anyways, having to prepare a radio show for 8 PM at 6 PM with absolutely nothing prepared beforehand. 

There isn't much to say beside that after everything was recorded and edited, it went straight into live with no check-ups whatsoever. \
Thank the Lord I didn't stutter or anything because it'd have been embarrassing, although I did use a stage name "Horace".

I have even received a feedback while my show was being broadcasted, saying that my show was a nice fresh take on the usual theme of the radio. \
At the end of the day, I felt more satisfaction than cringe, which was honestly surprising given my initial irk at the task.

TL;DR: Good experience and would (maybe) do it again if the occasion arises.
