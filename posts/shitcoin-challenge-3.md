From 4k back to 3k, the crypto market wiped an entire month of progress.

SHEEEEEESH.

# Commitment and sheer willpower

I could have sold, I know I should have, and I almost did.

However, to keep the integrity of the challenge, I rode this shit to oblivion.\
You're welcome.

Bitcoin hit an all-time-high at $73777, which led my shitcoin portfolio to
skyrocket to new highs as well.

However, as the expression says, what goes up must come down.\
And this is especially true in crypto.

**$4170.11** is the high I reached on the 10th of March 2024, before it fell
**25.16%** down to **$3120.83**.

Your monthly reminder that I bought 300 dollars of each coin on January
1st, 2024.

Aleph Zero is still being a bitch and going to Zero as you can see.

## Conclusion

Got too euphoric; now I'm paying the price.

On the bright side, I received 37,600 **_cat in a dogs world_** / **$MEW**
airdrop from buying a crypto phone, which I sold for $256.\
So, I've got that going for me, which is nice.
