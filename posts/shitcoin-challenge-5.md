Welcome to Month 6 of the Shitcoin Challenge where I showcase my questionable
financial decisions to the world.

We're going back up, boys. Fasten your seatbelts.

I'm going out on a limb here and predicting that everything will go up by the
next update. \
I have suffered through **2 years of bear market**, so trust me, I know what I'm
doing now and I can definitely predict the market (no).

Your monthly reminder that I bought 300 dollars of each coin on January
1st, 2024.

From $2208.04 last month to $2790.01 today, this is a solid **26.35%** increase,
which I'll gladly take.

I am most surprised by Stargate, which made a massive 50.77% surge 3 days ago
and is finally in the green.

I'm not even going to talk about Aleph **ZERO**â€”the name speaks for itself.

## Conclusion

I'm not wrapping this challenge unless I achieve at least a x3 return. \
Fuck it.

Chama.
