Everybody has been talking about AI this year, so I couldn't resist implementing
it into my website to ride the hype.

## The Future of Internet

With the addition of my AI chat feature, I aim to revolutionize the way we
communicate online. \
This powerful tool not only saves time and resources but also enhances user satisfaction
by providing instant, accurate, and personalized responses.

So, whether you're a business owner looking to streamline customer support or an
individual seeking an intelligent conversation companion, my AI bot is here to
make your life easier and more engaging.

Get ready to experience the future of conversations!

## Reality

It's terrible at answering questions, and it gets even worse when you use a
language other than English.

It even talks shit from time to time :

He really just called me an unprofessional ass and a complete waste of space,
this is what AI is all about.

## Conclusion

God bless AI, please don't kill me in the near future.

A big thanks to Vercel and their fantastic
[AI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai) library for making this possible, and
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) for providing the data (Looking at you,
OpenAI, with your free API that doesn't work unless you put in your credit card
info).

Thank you for reading, the code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Xian-Wei/zhuxw).
