It's officially time for me to start thinking about blog posts again.

Honestly I'm struggling to find words even now as I'm writing this.

Writer's block, anyone ?

I'll definitely need a fresh blog post idea ASAP.

63.95 dollars gain from January to December, what a ride.

Turns out shitcoins are totally safe investments, eh? (Okay, maybe not so much.)

Unsurprisingly, Aleph Zero is back to being the star of my portfolio. \
Morpheus Network? It stood no chance against the Ultimate Shitcoin.

The lesson? You only need 1 or 2 winners to make it in crypto.

## Conclusion

I'm considering starting a trading challenge next year.

Past me wrote about starting a _serious_ coin challenge to shake off writer's
block, and honestly it would be a brillant idea if it weren't for the fact that
we might be nearing a bear market for cryptocurrencies.

Stay tuned for what I might be cooking next year.
