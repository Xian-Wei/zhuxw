I am almost two days late for my monthly crypto hate post, and I apologize for
that. \
Here's a quick recap of what my past self had to say last month:

_"All-time low on my portfolio"_, he said.\
**Little did he know his portfolio would tank 14% more in the following month.**

_"This one especially hurts, as one of my coin went down the gutter and is now
worth less than 100 dollars"_, he said. \
**Spoiler alert: there are now three coins under 100 dollars.**

I dread the day my portfolio drops to 3 figures.

No comment.

Except maybe: **j√§vla helvete**.

## Conclusion

Can't wait for this challenge to end, so I can sell it all and move on.

See you in October for yet another L.
