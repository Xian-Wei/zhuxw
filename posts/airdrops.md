This is more of a time capsule for my future self than anything.

However it might still interest the few readers in here who don't view crypto
solely as a scam.

## What are airdrops ?

To begin, we need to define what airdrops are, as they are quite hard to grasp
for the average no-coiners.

An airdrop is basically free money for clicking on websites.\
We're talking about rewards ranging from two to six figures just for using a mouse
and a keyboard.

Yes, it's absurd.

## How do airdrops work ?

In essence, projects distribute money to users who click and interact with their
apps using various secret criteria like interacting with a specific feature or
have a certain amount of interactions.

If a user doesn't meet these criteria, they won't be eligible for the rewards,
and their share will be distributed to eligible users.\
Projects get paid for each interaction, so it's not a one-way street.

Airdrops also serve as major marketing campaigns, incentivizing people to try
their apps with the hope that they'll become durable users.

## Type of airdrops

There are 2 main types of airdrops:

- **Interaction-based airdrops**: This involves clicking on every feature you
  see on a website, trying to meet as many criteria as possible. The specific
  criteria are unknown, which filters out low-quality users who just click on
  the most obvious things without properly researching the project. This method
  reaps the most rewards if done properly since most people donâ€™t meet all the
  criteria.

- **Point-based airdrops**: This involves depositing money on the website to
  earn massive interest. The problem is that there are millionaires who deposit
  large amounts of money and reap most of the rewards, leaving less for poor
  participants like me.

## Benefits and Risks

Benefits:

- Potentially life-changing money
- Being a pioneer in new technologies
- Receiving "shares" from a new project that could grow in the future

Risks:

- A lot of scams
- Time-consuming
- Easy to make mistakes
- You might end up clicking for nothing

## How much did I get from airdrops ?

Peanuts.

The problem is that "airdrop farming" has become too popular among cryptobros,
significantly diluting the rewards due to the sheer number of participants.

Moreover, industries have started to exploit this system, using bots and AI to
generate as many clicks as possible, and posing as thousands of "unique users".

Chances are, by the time you read this, airdrops will no longer be a thing
because of them.

## Conclusion

Although it's essentially free money, it's also very easy to lose it since it's
crypto.

It also requires a mind of steel as the value of your crypto fluctuates with the
market and could potentially crash on you.

**Looking at you zkSync.**

TL;DR : If you don't do your own research, there's a big chance you'll just lose
everything.
