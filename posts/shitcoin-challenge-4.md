Back to square one.

Well, shit.

# Almost looks like a poo

My gains are almost as impressive as a pile of poo, with two months of progress
down the drain.

The drop was as steep as the rise from month 2; you can even visualize a poo
figure in the chart.

"What goes up must come down" I said back in Month 3. \
However I wasn't expecting to regress back to January values.

WHERE IS THE BULL RUN I WAS PROMISED, HALVING MY ASS.

Your monthly reminder that I bought 300 dollars of each coin on January
1st, 2024.

Aleph Zero taking L's since day one, surprise, surprise.

The biggest disappointment ? Myria, which soared **67%** to around **$487** and
is now down to **$189**. \
Just a casual **-58%** in 2 months, nothing crazy.

## Conclusion

I'm planning to wrap up this shitcoin challenge by month 6, hopefully it won't
go to zero by the time the challenge ends.

Remember kids, don't buy shitcoins.
