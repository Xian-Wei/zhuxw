I was about to write and brag about how my blog had a new interface and was
redesigned to a better and usable state.

However as I created the file for this post I immediately noticed that the order
in which my posts are displayed is completely wrong, which makes me reluctant to
actually write about this update.

Just so you know I had previously created 2 posts in this blog, the
[first](/post/hello-world) being a self-introduction and the
[second](/post/todo-list) being a to-do list for myself.

![Damn bug](/images/blog/3-screenshot.png)

Yeah I'm definitely fixing this bug before I take on the rest of this post. \
I must say past Xian-Wei from a week ago really disappoints.

## The so-called "update"

There were plans to make a light/dark theme but making a website look good in
two different color palettes is a pain in the ass, so you're gonna have to bear
with this dark edgy theme.

I also added a nice background freshly drawn on Photoshop in 5 minutes with my
mighty Razer mouse **#ad**

Feature-wise I added tags for posts as well as a search bar so you can filter my
innumerable posts however you like.

Not gonna lie it took me waaaay longer than I thought it would take. \
My CSS and design skills, being absolutely deplorable, made it so I spent 80% of
my time developing the interface.

That's it, that's all I have for now. Yes.

## What's to come

I'm working on NFTs that I'm gonna be giving for free when you connect your
crypto wallet (MetaMask browser extension) to this website.

> Oh no Xian-Wei is a cryptobro !

For all of you haters, HAVE FUN STAYING POOR ! \
Just kidding.

As a matter of fact, my net worth would be considerably higher had I not traded
shitcoins left and right (or had I not gotten into crypto at all **_sob_**). \
It doesn't matter because all of us crypto investors are in it for the tech and not
for the money, right ?

## My NFT collection

Don't expect to make money out of this.

I haven't drawn them yet but I can already tell you they will be terrible. \
My drawing talent is negative, I'd even go as far as to say that my ability to draw
is on par with my design skills.

You're gonna have a hard time selling my awful NFTs unless some morons suddenly
decide that my "art" has value. \
You should seriously consider a career in sales if you actually manage to sell yours.

Anyway that's all I have for now, peace.
