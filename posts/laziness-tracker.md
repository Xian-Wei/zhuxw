At last, the [Tracker](https://www.zhuxw.com/weight) page has been updated.

Many moons ago, the Tracker page (formerly the About page) was essentially about
me whining about that one Chinese gentleman who happens to share the same name
as myself and beat me in Google search ranks for our respective websites.

Well, I'm happy to announce I've been sitting on the Google search throne for
our name for a while now, using my **advanced** SEO techniques to take him down.

The next step is to have my own Wikipedia page because his still plagues the
results.

Enough chatter, let's dive into today's topic.

## Weight tracker

Charts are truly one of the inventions of all time.

As of today (more like 2-3 weeks ago, too lazy to write the post lol), you can
track my weight loss journey in real-time by observing my
[weight](https://www.zhuxw.com/weight) fluctuations across multiple charts.

Do you notice the significant weight spike ?

This is called Dirty Bulking during a pandemic, with the government shutting
down gyms.

My 2020 self was very smart, yes.

## Workout tracker

Additionally, I've also been keeping track of all my
[workouts](https://www.zhuxw.com/workout) since September 2019, which was a
great idea if I must say so myself.

I've noticed a clear correlation between me gaining weight and slowly losing my
discipline and motivation to go to the gym, which was eye-opening when I first
saw the charts.

## Conclusion

zhuxw 1.0 is over.

All the features I had in mind for now are pretty much developed.

This is all I have for today's post.

The thumbnail is from Himouto! Umaru-Chan.\
I've tried to draw her but it's too hard and laziness took over.\
Please don't copystrike me; this is a non-profit blog, and there's literally no
better illustration for my lack of motivation than her.

Please listen to **WHITE NIGHT** by Jake Miller and **If I Can Stop One Heart
From Breaking** by HOYO-MiX ; I've been binge-listening these songs.

Umarun~
