It's a very cool date, so to celebrate, here's a new (and arguably useless) blog
post.

This is also the day I begin my journey to grow my socials and experiment with
different things.

I currently have a whopping **188 followers**, gained mostly by writing bullshit
on other people's posts from time to time.

## Analytics

Here are my analytics as of today:

I found out not long ago that I somehow became part of a predominantly Turkish
community, which has flooded my X feed with posts I cannot understand.

My goal for the next update is to drastically reduce that Turkish audience (no
offense to the Turkish people, I'm just linguistically limited).

An interesting insight: my audience doesn't have a lot of zoomers! \
Instead it consists mostly of people in their 30s and 40s which was completely unexpected.

Honestly, the stats are decent considering I've only been shitposting random
stuff.

Soon, though, these numbers will go stonks.

## Conclusion

No conclusionâ€”I'm ditching that meta.
