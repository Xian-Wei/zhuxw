At long last I am thrilled to announce that the $ZHU token finally has
"utility". \
You can now redeem an NFT from the Shop section in the Web3 Sidebar.

## What exactly is a Zhuba NFT ?

It is the official zhuxw NFT that can only be minted using $ZHU token. \
Each NFT comes in five different rarities :

- Ultra Rare (Orange, 5%)
- Super Rare (Purple, 10%)
- Rare (Blue, 15%)
- Uncommon (Green, 30%)
- Common (Grey, 40%)

Redeeming a Zhuba NFT costs 10000 $ZHU and triggers a verifiable random function
on-chain to ensure that the randomness of the NFTs cannot be rigged.

You can find the NFT collection on
[OpenSea](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xf9C8D1a5b0a96f7Ba416273a061a9a70968f873d).

## So what's the utility ?

A $ZHU token dump.

So tokenomics, much useful, very wow.

The primary purpose is to provide a way for token holders to offload their
tokens. \
As of now, the NFTs are on Testnet and do not hold any real-world value.

## Conclusion

Enjoy dumping your $ZHU.

I'm pretty much done with the Web3 part of the website for now, but I might add
more **_decentralized_** features later as new ideas come to mind.

Thank you for reading, the code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Xian-Wei/zhuxw-core).

**Happy 4/20 !**
