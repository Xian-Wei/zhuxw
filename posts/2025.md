**Post #25 of the blog on the 25th of January 2025.**

Can you believe I wrote exactly 24 posts since the start of this blog just to be able to make that commemorational **25th post on January 25th 2025** ? 

This was definitely planned and not at all a coincidence, trust me.

I have most certainly not been procrastinating for 25 days to write my first post of the year which was supposed to be the closure of my 1 year shitcoin challenge on January 1st.\
No, none of that.

Anyways, let's dive in today's topic which is NOTHING.

Yes I have nothing planned but I feel compelled to write a post because we're already at the end of the month and I said I would actually start improving on my writing skills this year.

So I just got banned 40 minutes on X/Twitter for *violating their rules against **inauthentic** accounts*.

Well first of all, thank you for blatantly accusing me of being an unoriginal and imitative person.

You know what the worst about this situation is ? I literally subscribed to their yearly premium on December. 

Retar Dio.
