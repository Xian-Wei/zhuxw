Well, well, well, would you look at that ?

Now, that's the update I was looking forward to.

First comes red and despair, then green and euphoria.

# February has been GREAT

Let's get straight to the point.

We went from $1709.07 just one month ago to $3406.59 today.

That's an overall increase of **99.32%** in just 29 days.

(I've updated this post three times already, the portfolio jumped from $3338.83 to $3388.22 to $3406.59 in literal minutes.)

Shoutout to Batman for protecting Arkham City because the Arkham token clearly carried this entire portfolio.

$ARKM went from being valued at **$266.93** to **$1321.72** in just one month.\
Only in crypto can you see an asset's value multiply by **4.95 / 395.15%** in such a short amount of time.

Quick reminder: I bought 300 dollars of each coin on the January 1st, 2024.

Kaspa has been doing fantastic as well.

Aleph Zero on the other hand...

All my homies hate $AZERO.

## Conclusion

Buy random shitcoins during a bear market, hold, and get rich.
