Only two months left before I have to get serious and start writing actual blog
posts.

How thrilled I am to wrack my brain for new topics to write about!

The ascending triangle on the daily timeframe shows consolidation around the
$1500 key support...

I'm calling it: this is the bottom.

Up only from here.

Arkham carrying this entire portfolio since the beginning of the challenge
brings a tear to my eye.

Just imagine if I hadn't bought it.

## Conclusion

Maybe I'll spin up a _serious_ coin challenge just so I can slack off on my
writing again... and maybe even make money this time.
