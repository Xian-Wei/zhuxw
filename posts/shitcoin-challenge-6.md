This is Month 7 of pain and sadness as I am officially **DOWN** on my initial
investment.

Needless to say I'm starting to regret starting this whole thing but I'll keep
going because what is 2100 dollars in a lifetime right ? (You can't see me
crying behind my screen)

It was going so well...

Aleph Zero and Myria are very close to being under 100 dollars which is killing
me.

For those picking up in the middle of this challenge, I spent 300 dollars on
each of these shitcoins.

Surprisingly, Arkham is still doing great.

Can't say the same for its brother Aleph Zero though.

## Conclusion

Excuse the length of this post; I need to order a gaming mouse, and they will
deliver it tomorrow if I order before midnight (it's currently 11:47 PM).
