All-time low on my portfolio as we get on month 8 of my "How to lose money"
tutorial.

This one especially hurts, as one of my coin went down the gutter and is now
worth less than 100 dollars.

Brace yourself for what was initially worth 300 bucks.

How is Myria performing worse than the infamous Aleph **ZERO** ? \

Also, remember when Arkham did a x5 in one month ? Pepperidge Farm remembers.

## Conclusion

If this doesn't convince you not to buy shitcoins, then I don't know what will.

All of this is not financial advice, not that you'd take it anyway, seeing the
performance of my portfolio.
