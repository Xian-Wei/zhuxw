It is officially the end of the shitcoin challenge, and I'm **30 days late** in wrapping it up.

## The Damage

From January 2024 to January 2025, I have lost exactly **$624.91**, which represents a **29.75% decrease** from my initial investment.

And here's the kicker: this happened despite **Bitcoin skyrocketing from $42,000 in 2024 to $105,000 today**.

For those new to crypto, Bitcoin is the metronome of the market—when BTC moves, most other coins tend to follow. 

The fact that my portfolio massively underperformed means I should have just stuck with good ol’ BTC.

A final reminder: that I started this challenge with 300 dollars in each shitcoin.

- **Biggest loser**: Aleph Zero (-84.57%) - an absolute disaster.
- **Best performer**: Arkham (+112%)—which, compared to BTC’s rally, still feels like a loss.

Looking at these numbers, I’m only now realizing just how terrible of an idea this was.

**Fuck Aleph Zero** one last time.

Honestly I should have known, **Zero** was literally in the name.

I took this hit so you don’t have to.

- Do your own research before investing in anything.
- Don’t buy random coins just because they’re on the market—that’s how you end up with a portfolio like mine.
- **What goes up must come down**.

## Conclusion

The irony? Despite losing money, I have never bought this many shitcoins before in my life.

An ever-shifting meta had me constantly chasing gains, and strangely enough, it's been working alright. 

Lessons were learned, and the game goes on.

New trading challenge starts in February. 

**Stay tuned.**
