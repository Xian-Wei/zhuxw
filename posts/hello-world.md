**Hello and welcome to my very first blog post !**

Hello everybody I am Xian-Wei Zhu, a hopeless 24 years old wantrepreneur kid from the internet whose interests vary day to day.

This is a first from a (hopefully) long series of blog posts where I'll be sharing all the boring things I do in my life.

I like to call myself a developer as 90% of my free time is dedicated to ~~procrastinating~~ developing random stuff, so you can mainly expect tech/development-related articles from this site. \
I also really like video games, so who knows ? Maybe I'll be posting a game review (that nobody cares about) one of these days.

As of now I've developed anything but useful stuff, however this blog is the first step towards productivity and financial freedom.

## What this blog is about

This is what I think I will be posting in here (I have no inspiration right now and am basically forcing myself to write this) :

1. Shitposts
2. Devlogs
3. Upcoming features on this app
4. Project ideas
5. My life in general
6. Shitposts

## My life so far

![I'm tired yes](/images/blog/1-imtired.png)

- Procrastinating for years
- Stuck in tutorial hell for whatever I was planning on doing
- Stopped all my projects halfway through
- Sleep 10 hours a day
- Waste hours of my time watching my favorite crypto go up and down in a candlestick chart
- Daydream about how life would be as a billionaire

## How this app was made

```js
export default function zhuxw() {
  return "This blog was made using NextJS, Tailwind Typography plugin and Markdown";
}
```

## What's to come on this website

- Candlestick chart of my weight \
  (been keeping track of my weight in an Excel sheet since September 2019)
- Speculating/gambling on my weight and have a chance of winning (worthless) ERC-20 tokens
- Crypto faucet to get started with gambling
- Host this website in a decentralized manner
- Mess around with styling
- Dashboard for my other projects

## Yes.

That's it. \
Don't expect anything from this website, it is very likely that I'm just gonna forget about all of this and go back to procrastinating but we never know. \
You can find the complete code of this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xian-Wei/zhuxw/tree/develop).
