**Hello and welcome to my very first blog post !**

I am Xian-Wei Zhu, a wantrepreneur gremlin who's passionate about technology in general (especially money-making technologies such as cryptocurrencies).

**I like money.**

As of now I've developed anything but useful stuff, however this blog is the first step towards productivity and financial freedom.

## What this blog is about

The purpose of this blog is for me to keep track of everything I do as well as share my work to the world. \
This is pretty much what you can expect from this blog :

1. Shitposts
2. Devlogs
3. Upcoming features on this app
4. Project ideas
5. My life in general
6. Shitposts

## My life so far

![I'm tired yes](/images/imtired.png)

- Procrastinating for years
- Stuck in tutorial hell for whatever I was planning on doing
- Stopped all my projects halfway through
- Sleep 10 hours a day
- Waste hours of my time watching my favorite crypto go up and down in a candlestick chart
- Daydream about how life would be as a billionaire

## How this app was made

```js
export default function zhuxw() {
  return "This blog was made using NextJS, Tailwind and Markdown";
}
```

## What's to come on this website

- Candlestick chart of my weight \
  (been keeping track of my weight in an Excel sheet since September 2019)
- Speculating/gambling on my weight and have a chance of winning (worthless) ERC-20 tokens
- Crypto faucet to get started with gambling
- Host this website in a decentralized manner
- Mess around with styling
- Dashboard for my other projects

## Yes.

That's it. \
Don't expect anything from this website, it is very likely that I'm just gonna forget about all of this and go back to procrastinating but we never know. \
You can find the complete code of this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/Xian-Wei/zhuxw/tree/develop).
