Today's post is a bit different as I had no inspiration and nothing specific to
talk about.

# What is ZZZ?

Zenless Zone Zero is a gacha action RPG developed by miHoYo and released on July
4, 2024.

The game is set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic world where supernatural
disasters spawn dimensions that allow hideous monsters to roam free.

You get to choose one of two siblings to play as the protagonist of the story,
whose job is to guide people through the disasters.

(Men of culture will choose Belle over Wise. Don't be uncultured.)

# My expectations

I had high expectations as a big Hoyoverse fan. \
For context, I've been religiously playing their games daily, from their first hit
game Genshin Impact to their latest game Honkai: Star Rail, and I don't plan on stopping
any time soon.

Needless to say, I'm a big fan of theirs and I recognize the quality of Hoyo's
games when I play them.

Some may say it's a sunk-cost fallacy, and I don't disagree since I'm starting
to be burnt out on Genshin Impact. \ But you really can't help it after it has
been your routine for so many years.

Anyways, back to ZZZ.

# Brief review

From my experience, it's a really good game for people with limited/moderate
time as you can finish your daily missions in less than 5 minutes and move on
with your day.

And if you're willing to play more, the game has more than enough content for
you to sink hours into.

One of the main appeals of the game is the overall visuals, which are amongst
the best I've seen in video games. \
From the cutscenes to the character animations, everything is truly breathtaking.

Gameplay is also notable for being smooth and simple enough that you can turn
your brain off and still be able to play.

And I've heard the mobile port has great controls and is pretty easy to pick up
too.

# The goods

- Not capped at 60 FPS, unlike its predecessors

- Exploration system is time-saving and straightforward

- Daily missions take less than 5 minutes

- Character design is peak

- General aesthetic is exquisite

- OST is great

- Multiplayer arcade games

- Interactive storytelling through comic book-style narration

- Grace Howard

- Anby Demara

- Hoshimi Miyabi

# The bads

- Lack of depth in combat

- It gets repetitive

- Can't use characters outside of battles

- Due to the nature of the game, there isn't much to do outside of battle
  instances

- Story isn't engaging

- Friend system but no multiplayer outside of arcade?

# Conclusion

Overall, a very solid 8.5/10.

I'm a sucker for gacha games and waifus, so I'm obviously biased.

If you're a waifu/husbando enjoyer and/or a weeb, this is the game for you.
