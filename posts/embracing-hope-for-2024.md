## Happy 1st anniversary to the zhuxw blog

It has officially been one year since my first post on this blog. \
Despite my initial commitment to posting once a month, I only managed a total of 8 posts throughout the entire year.

**Sorry I suck.**

## Lessons learned

Maintaining a blog is no easy feat.

For someone with virtually no life and nothing exciting to recount, coming up with post ideas has proven to be a challenging task.

Additionally, I've come to realize that my English writing skills needs polishing. \
Writing for the blog is way different than chatting with the boys on Discord. \
Good thing AI's got my back, pinpointing the frequent reuse of words and helping me fix the awkward phrasing.

## One year of zhuxw

Considering my mental health throughout this year, I'd give myself a 7/10 for updating this website with the features I had in mind.\
As a recap for me to look back on, here are all the things I managed to develop on zhuxw :

- A blog system (duh)
- A 3D display of the website name (special thanks to [CactusArtz](https://cactusartz.artstation.com/) for the fantastic 3D model, though I lack permission to include his name in here but I couldn't care less because he's cringe)
- A chart that displays my weight (updated daily using a mobile app I developed this year)
- My Zhuba NFT collection along with a gacha system built on-chain
- My own cryptocurrency $ZHU to acquire the aforementioned NFT
- A decentralized system built on Ethereum to trade my weight on-chain (which has a massive flaw, but nobody will find out anyway)
- The most intelligent real-time AI chatbot, _ahem_

## What's to come in 2024

- I'm kicking off a $1000 shitcoin challenge where I'll be posting my cryptocurrency portfolio performances monthly on my blog.
- I commit to putting up a blog post each month (I swear I will)
- Expect more useless features on zhuxw

## On a personal level

I've experienced a terrible 2023, both physically and mentally.

In a few days, I'll be turning 25, and I feel like everybody around me is moving forward in life. \
I haven't had a real job yet and it has almost been 3 years since I graduated college.

I've been trying to get started on my own entrepreneurial journey but my lack of self-discipline and confidence in myself have been fueling my procrastination to a point where it's significantly affecting my mental health.

Not a day goes by without me thinking about project ideas, but whenever I start one, I can't find it in myself to finish it because it feels futile and useless.

Moreover, the 16 kilograms I've gained during the Covid era have been weighing on me for the past three years, gradually crushing my self-confidence.

**HOWEVER** after hours of self-reflection, despite all this negativity, I (believe I) am starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. \
These recent days haven't been so bad, and I've been feeling a bit better.

Despite the negativity, as of today, I weigh 75.9 kilograms, which hasn't been achieved since March 2021.
I've been hitting the gym more, aiming for at least 3 times a week and surpass my peak physique of 2017/2018 at 63 kilograms and 10-15% bodyfat.

Additionally, Mixed Martial Arts has grown on me a lot this year, so I might try boxing/kickboxing if I find it in myself to overcome my anxiety about going to the boxing gym.

Code-wise, I've also never coded this much in a year before (although GitHub commits mean nothing).

This, coupled with creating the blog and writing posts, has been a creative and entrepreneurial challenge for me to maintain consistency in my work. \
I believe I've pulled it off thus far, and I plan on doing even better from now on.

PS: Look forward to the evolution of my artistic side through better post thumbnails.

Let's hope all of this won't age like milk.

## Conclusion

2023 has been bad, I'm certain that 2024 will be better.
I will continue updating my blog post as it serves as a great exercise for me to enhance my creativity and transition from being a consumer to a producer.

Cheers to a promising year ahead !
