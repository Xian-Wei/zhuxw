## Happy 1st anniversary to the zhuxw blog

It has officially been one year since my first post on this blog.
Despite my initial commitment to posting once a month, I only managed a total of 8 posts throughout the entire year.

Sorry I suck.

## Lessons learned

Maintaining a blog is no easy feat.

For someone with virtually no life and nothing exciting to recount, coming up with post ideas has proven to be a challenging task.

Additionally, I've come to realize that my English writing skills are severely lacking. \
It is quite a different experience than chatting with the boys on Discord. \
AI has been great at pinpointing the frequent reuse of words and bad wording in general.

## One year of zhuxw

Considering my mental health throughout this year, I'd give myself a 7/10 for updating this website with the features I had in mind.\
As a recap for me to look back on, here are all the things I managed to develop on zhuxw :

- A blog system (duh)
- A 3D display of the website name (special thanks to [CactusArtz](https://cactusartz.artstation.com/) for the fantastic 3D model, though I lack permission to include his name in here but I couldn't care less because he's cringe)
- A chart that displays my weight (updated daily using a mobile app I developed this year)
- My Zhuba NFT collection along with a gacha system built on-chain
- My own cryptocurrency $ZHU to acquire the aforementioned NFT
- A decentralized system built on Ethereum to trade my weight on-chain (which has a massive flaw, but nobody will find out anyway)
- The most intelligent real-time AI chatbot _ahem_

# What's to come in 2024

- I'm kicking off a $1000 shitcoin challenge where I'll be posting my cryptocurrency portfolio performances monthly on my blog. \
- I commit to putting up a blog post each month (I swear I will)
- More useless features on zhuxw

## Conclusion

I will continue updating my blog post as it serves as a great exercise for me to enhance my creativity and transition from being a consumer to a producer.
